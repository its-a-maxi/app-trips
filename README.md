<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

Take-home challenge from BizAway.

The objective is to create a simple travel platform, which will allow the user to interact with a list of travels fetched from an API.
Travels from the list can be opened on a new page to see a more detailed view.
The list has to be filterable and has to keep its state when navigating to other pages and going back.
A trip of the day feature has to be implemented where a random travel is shown, the travel musn't change during the duration of the day.

Unit tests had to be developed for the app.
